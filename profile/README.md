## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ We are a small group of students at [IIS A. Avogadro](https://www.sito.itisavogadro.org) working on an Open Source instant messaging service <br>
🌈 We value community contributions. See [Our commitment to openness and modularity](#Our-commitment-to-openness-and-modularity) for more information <br>
🍿 Fun fact: most of us go to Gianni's bar during the break


## Our commitment to openness and modularity
We provide Reference Implementations for all our products in the form of clients, servers and libraries, but we also plan on providing documentation about the underlying protocols, design patterns and APIs to allow third-party developers to create custom experiences. <br>

We are also commited to publishing all our source code on this GitHub Organization under Free or Open Source licenses to provide developers with in-depth knowledge of our platofrms and allow them to improve, extend and audit our code in a cooperative and inclusive manner.
